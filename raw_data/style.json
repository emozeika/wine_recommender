intense structure, deep tannins and ripe berry flavors.\n\nAll Bordeaux style blends, including those from Australia are suitable for aging and most will benefit from some time decanting to allow them to \u201copen up\u201d.\n\nThe flavor profile of Australian Bordeaux blends is largely up to the discretion of the winemaker. As in Bordeaux, wines based more heavily on Cabernet Sauvignon will typically be more structured, while wines based on Merlot are a bit more fruit-forward and approachable.\n\nTypically, wines based on Cabernet Sauvignon tend to be both better regarded and more expensive than their Merlot based counter-parts, although that is a rather subjective generalization that is changing.\n\nLike most Australian wines, these offer great bang for the buck. The best Bordeaux blends tend to come from cooler climate regions such as Coonawarra and Margaret River, but they can also be found in Yarra Valley, South Australia, McLaren Vale, and Orange.\n\nAs with other Bordeaux blends, these full-bodied wines are best paired with red meat and hearty fare that can stand up to their strong tannins and full body.", "blurb": "Cabernet and Merlot based",

Terroir is a concise way to define a specific region based upon the soil, climate, and the collective knowledge of the generations of people who have farmed the land.\n\nWhen shopping for Bordeaux reds, keep in mind, French wines are all about the region and the blend, not about individual grape varieties.

California, and reigns supreme as the most popular wine consumed in the US (that's including reds and whites).\n\nChardonnay can trace its humble origins to Burgundy. Today it is the most widely planted white wine grape in the world. Why?\n\nChardonnay is prized because it's a hardy, vigorous vine that readily reflects \u201cterroir\u201d (a French term referring to the characteristics imparted to a wine by the climate and soil in which it is grown). Stylistically, Chardonnay can be clean with bright acidity or full-bodied with tropical notes and varying degrees of oak. In California, the latter is the more popular style.\n\nSonoma Coast Chards have more acidity. The coastal fog lends a degree of cooling and these wines will often exhibit pear and crisp apple notes, as well as lively citrus characteristics. Napa Valley Chards lean toward a riper and fuller style, with tropical fruit notes. Oak aging adds layers of vanilla, spice, butter and toasted hazelnut.\n\nOakier Chards with a slightly buttery profile have a natural affinity with rich seafood such as lobster or halibut. They also stand up well to eggs benedict, pork chops stuffed with apples or roasted butternut squash. Crisper, unoaked Chards are best paired with prawns, crab cakes, salads with mangos and or even mild curries.", "blurb": null, "interesting_facts": ["Chardonnay is one of the principal grapes used in the production of sparkling wine, and of course, Champagne.", "Wente Vineyards established the first commercial plantings of Chardonnay in Livermore during the 1940s.", "At the Judgement of Paris, a legendary wine competition held in Paris in 1976, Ch\u00e2teau Montelena beat top notch Chardonnays from Burgundy.", "Malolactic fermentation is responsible for that famous buttery note in Chardonnay.

Winemakers here like to experiment and it is even popular in Stellenbosch to blend Chardonnay with Sauvignon Blanc.

They pair well with a wide range of food making them an easy choice for a dinner.\n\nBeing surrounded by mountains on all sides has its advantages. The D\u00e3o region is protected from the climate of the continent and from the ocean. The elevation also gives the wine much of its character. Elevation ranges between 600 feet to 3,000 feet at some points.\n\nMost vineyards have small plots dotted through various hillsides and elevations. The soil is very poor making for stronger vines that can survive the shifts from cool nights to hot days.\n\nThe region is still considered off the beaten path and great value can be found in many of the wines.

wine growing region in Northeast France that borders Germany. Because Alsace is proximal to Germany, cradled in the shadow of the Vosges Mountain range and just west of the Rhine River, it shares many common grape varieties.\n\nGew\u00fcrztraminer can trace its lineage to Alsace, and is the second most planted variety in the region.\n\nGew\u00fcrztraminer is an aromatic grape, this is typically expressed as exotic fruits such as lychee, star fruit, passion fruit or mango. In addition to lush fruit notes, a host of other aromatics makes for a complex and heady elixir\u2014orange peel, roses, honey, and baking spices are also common fragrances. A deep gold color, it tends to be full-bodied with fairly low acidity and sometimes has a lovely spritz (or slight effervescence).\n\nAs a rule, Alsatian Gew\u00fcrztraminer is unoaked, and is produced in both a dry and off-dry style. Late Harvest Gew\u00fcrz are made as well, generally labeled as Vendange Tardive (VT) and S\u00e9lection de Grains Nobles (or SGN meaning that the wines have been affected by Noble Rot).\n\nUniversally known as the wine to pair with spicy Asian cuisine, Gew\u00fcrztraminer has a broader range of pairing potential. Both dry and off-dry Gew\u00fcrztraminer will compliment roast duck, washed-rind cheeses like Epoisses, cream of potato soup, bratwurst, omelets with smoked salmon and pizza with figs and Praga ham. Pair off-dry Gew\u00fcrztraminer with foie gras, apple tartin, or desserts featuring tropical fruit.", "blurb": null, "interesting_facts": ["Literally translated, Gew\u00fcrztraminer means \u201cspicy Traminer\u201d and is thought to be a mutation of Sauvignon Blanc.", "Alsatian wines are bottled in tall, flute shaped bottles called vin du Rhin or \u201cRhine wine bottle\u201d. They are known as hock bottles.", "Alsace wine is heavily influenced by Germany, the nationality of the region has changed several times through history, from France to Germany and vice-versa.", "The last time this change occurred was during World War II, Alsace was annexed by Germany in 1942 and was not returned to France until after the Allied Invasion in 1945."], "body": 5, "body_description":

Now, despite ripping up almost half of the Grenache vineyards, Spain is still producing amazing wines with Grenache. These wines range from affordable everyday wines to lavishly expensive world-class affairs.\n\nThese garnet-colored, fruit-forward wines showcase delightful flavors of candied red fruit, cinnamon, and black pepper.

Although hard to find, sparkling Gr\u00fcner are exceptionally fun to try.\n\nDry, delicate, with a tingly finish, this wine imparts significant citrus flavors of lime, lemon, and grapefruit. Some Gr\u00fcner also have a prevailing nectarine note as well. For non-fruits Gr\u00fcner, you can expect white pepper, and slight bitterness of flavors of vegetables like radish.\n\nIf oaked, which not all are, you will taste and smell nut and cream.

It's known for its big fruit, earthy tones and silky mouthfeel.\n\nMalbec is originally from the Bordeaux region of France where it is used as a blending grape. It was brought to South America in 1850 and has since found its home at high altitudes in Argentina and Chile.\n\nMalbec is a thin-skinned varietal that requires a lot of sun to ripen. Regions such as Maipo, Colchagua, and Maule are producing excellent Malbecs despite the growing conditions being very different in each region.\n\nMalbec loves big bold flavors and extremely juicy meats.

The fragrant aromas of white blossoms and ripe peaches are intoxicating.\n\nThis lovely wine will always be lower in alcohol and sweeter than the more famous Champagne, but those reasons are why it is so graceful.\n\nIn Northern Italy's Piedmont region, the town of Asti and a few surrounding provinces produce Italy's most popular sparkling wine, Moscato d'Asti. These wines are famous all over the world for their delicate sweetness and carbonation, which makes them immensely approachable and endlessly enjoyable.\n\nTrue Moscato d'Asti should not be confused with the slightly inferior Asti Spumante. Moscato d'Asti will always be about 5.5% alcohol and lightly fizzy and can be the perfect light wine for dessert or even breakfast. It often contains delightfully pungent aromas of white peaches, fresh white blossoms, and bright citrus.", "blurb": "Sparkling DOCG wine from Piedmont", "interesting_facts": ["Due to its low alcohol

Nebbiolo, Barbera, Dolcetto, Amarone and Valpolicella.\n\nArguably, the two most important regions in Northern Italy are Piedmont in the northwest, and Veneto in the northeast. Red wines from these regions range from some of the most expensive and sought after in all of Italy to great value red wines.\n\nNebbiolo produces some of the most exclusive and expensive red wines in Italy, including Barolo and Barbaresco. However, these sought after wines come with a hefty price tag.\n\nDolcetto and Barbera from Piedmont offer relative value.

They exude strong blackberry notes, as well as a good kick of cracked black pepper.\n\nThe grape was developed by Dr. Francois Durif in the 1870s as a hybrid grape that  wasn't susceptible Powdery Mildew. He named the grape Durif, though confusion about the strain later led to it being named Petite Sirah.\n\nPetite Sirah has mostly been utilized as a blending grape as it contributes body, depth and is adept at toning down excessive \u201cjaminess\u201d, though in recent years it has been given more of an opportunity to shine as a dominant varietal.\n\nLike many big juicy red wines Petite Sirah

It\u2019s a naturally aromatic grape, so winemaking here is focused on retaining the aromas and flavors of the grapes. Traditional winemakers often use large oak barrels, to minimize the addition of oaky flavors to the wine.\n\nAlsace Pinot Gris wines are rich, layered, and full-bodied, with beguiling aromas of lime, meyer lemon, green apple, a hint of white flowers, and notes of dried fruits and honey. They often have a silky texture and a medium to high acidity, which makes them perfect for aging.\n\nClassic food pairings include local foods like chestnuts and aged cheeses, but these wines can beautifully accompany a variety of dishes, from the distinctive flavor of venison, to spicy Thai coconut curry.", "blurb": null, "interesting_facts": ["Pinot Gris has a famous sibling: Pinot Noir.",

The greyish-blue grape grows well in the cooler areas of California's Central Coast.\n\nMost Pinot Gris is dry with notes of stone fruit, and is more neutral than Moscato or Riesling. There are many different styles of Pinot Gris which vary based on the climate and terroir (the complete natural environment of the wine).\n\nPinot Gris and Pinot Grigio are the same grape. Pinot Grigio is the Italian clone of the Alsatian Pinot Gris. While they are the same grape they do infer different styles. Pinot Gris is full-bodied, a little more viscous and more conducive to aging. Pinot Grigio is light, crisp and ready to go straight out of the supermarket.\n\nAlong with Chardonnay and White Zinfandel, Pinot Gris often referred to as a \u201cMom Wine\u201d given its popularity with the American middle-aged female population in the 80s and 90s.\n\nThink fish for your Pinot Gris. A little ceviche would be superb or perhaps some salmon or sashimi. American Pinot Gris tends to be a little more robust in the face of food and can withstand creamier dishes.", "blurb": null, "interesting_facts": ["The word pinot comes from the French word for pine

Widely planted, though once derided, Riesling is the superstar of the white wine world at the moment.\n\nThere is a lot of scope for versatility with this sweet, viscous wine, though you can expect to get hints of tropical fruit, nectarine, melon and pineapple from a solid Riesling.\n\nThe grape originated in the Rhine region of Germany, and the best of them are said to grow along the banks of the Mosel River on the beautiful steep, south facing hills.\n\nThere are six categories of Riesling which indicate the ripeness of the grapes. Kabinett is considered \u201coff-dry\u201d and is a typically ripe grape. Sp\u00e4tlese is riper and therefor sweeter, and Auslese is even riper still. Beyond on that you have Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese and Eiswein (or ice wine), all getting sweeter, more viscous and more expensive.\n\nIt's a favorite in the food and beverage industry because of its willingness to play with a wide variety of foods, particular spicy dishes. The current Asian fusion boom is thought to have had a tremendous effect on Riesling's popularity.", "blurb": null, "interesting_facts": ["Riesling is grown all over the world and thrives in cool to

Its two most important red grapes are Tempranillo and Garnacha.\n\nAlthough red wines from Rioja are prized, Spanish wines generally offer great bang for the buck, allowing one to indulge in quality vino without breaking the bank!\n\nThere are four categories of red wine in Rioja. The youngest of these is \u201cJoven\u201d. \u201cCrianza\u201d wines are required to age for a minimum of 2 years, with 6 months spent in oak barrels. The next level is \u201cReserva\u201d in which the wine ages for a minimum of 3 years, with at least 1 year in oak barrels. Finally, the most mature wines are labeled \u201cGran Reserva\u201d. These wines mature for minimum 2 years in oak barrels, followed by at least 3 years in the bottle.\n\nTypically younger wines will be lighter in body style, exhibit more fresh fruit characteristics and are suitable to drink while young. Older wines have more developed flavor profiles, earthy characteristics, and are better suited to aging.\n\nThe medium body and high acidity in Spanish red wines from Rioja makes them excellent for pairing with a variety of foods.

additional flavor and body.\n\nTheir medium body and complex flavor profile make these wines a great pairing with a wide range of foods such as grilled meats, hearty pasta and strong cheeses.\n\nRipasso della Valpolicella is a red wine from the Veneto region of Italy. The wine is produced by putting Valpolicella Classico under a second fermentation by adding the skins remaining from Amarone and Recioto production.\n\nThis winemaking process imparts additional complexity, tannin, body, and slightly higher alcohol to the wine. Both the body and price point of this wine are somewhere between a Valpolicella Classico and a true Amarone.\n\nRipasso wines are more approachable on both the palette and the wallet! They retail at far more accessible price points than true Amarone- generally in the $15-$25 price range.\n\nRipasso della Valpolicella is a wine based on the Corvina grape, with the addition of Rondinella and Molinara rounding out the blend.\n\nIn 2009, Ripasso della Valpolicella received its own DOC designation, along with its cousin, Amarone. In fact, they are sometimes known as \u201cbaby Amarone.\u201d", "blurb": "Corvina-based DOC wine from Veneto", "interesting_facts": ["The term Ripasso means \u201crepassed,\u201d which refers to the

The wines are usually light, crisp, and brimming with gorgeous flavors of zesty lime, grapefruit, and melon. These fruit flavors are perfectly complemented with subtle herbal flavors. Some say that Sauvignon Blanc smells like freshly mown grass.\n\nOne of the best parts about Sauvignon Blanc is that it is relatively inexpensive. A lack of new oak and smaller demand, keeps its prices lower than Chardonnay. You can get great deals on these.

the great potential for grape growing in New Zealand.\n\nSauvignon Blanc tends to be fermented in stainless steel vats, which results in a clean, crisp flavor, and will not show any of that

The wine is thought to have originated in the Minho province in the far north of Portugal.\n\nThe carbonation in the bottle occurs from a process called malolactic fermentation, and while this is typically considered to be a defect in the wine the Vinho Verde producers found that the consumers rather liked it.\n\nBecause of the wine's bracing acidity and oceanic minerality it should be considered to be the ultimate partner to raw shellfish.", "blurb": "White wine from Northern Portugal", "interesting_facts": ["Growers quite often plant their vines of telephone poles of large walls in order to grow fruit and vegetables beneath the vines.", "Vinho Verde is a wine intended to be consumed young.", "15% of Portugal's natural viticultural area is dedicated to the production of Vinho Verde."], "body": 1, "body_description": "Very light-bodied", "acidity": 3, "acidity_description": "High", "country": {"code": "pt", "name": "Portugal", "native_name": "Portugal", "seo_name": "portugal", "currency": {"code": "EUR", "name": "Euros", "prefix": "\u20ac", "suffix": null}, "regions_count": 91, "users_count": 1037066, "wines_count": 53763, "wineries_count": 5795, "most_used_grapes": [{"id": 67, "name": "Touriga Nacional", "seo_name": "touriga-nacional", "has_detailed_info": true, "wines_count": 85787}, {"id": 68, "name": "Touriga Franca", "seo_name": "touriga-franca", "has_detailed_info": false, "wines_count": 33763}, {"id": 69, "name": "Tinta Roriz", "seo_name": "tinta-roriz", "has_detailed_info": false, "wines_count": 41047}]}, "wine_type_id": 2, "food": [{"id": 13, "name": "Shellfish", "background_image": {"location": "//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/13_shellfish.png", "variations": {"small": "//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/thumbs/13_shellfish_932x810.png"}}, "seo_name": "shellfish"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Vegetarian", "background_image": {"location": "//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/19_vegetarian.png", "variations": {"small": "//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/thumbs/19_vegetarian_932x810.png"}}, "seo_name": "vegetarian"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Appetizers and snacks", "background_image": {"location": "//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/27_appetizers-snacks.png", "variations": {"small": "//images.vivino.com/backgrounds/foods/thumbs/27_appetizers-snacks_932x810.png"}}, "seo_name": null}], "grapes": [{"id": 128, "name": "Arinto de Bucelas", "seo_name": "arinto-de-bucelas", "has_detailed_info": false, "wines_count": 26547}, {"id": 149, "name": "Loureiro", "seo_name": "loureiro", "has_detailed_info": false, "wines_count": 7136}, {"id": 546, "name": "Alvarinho", "seo_name": "alvarinho", "has_detailed_info": false, "wines_count": 10034}, {"id": 548, "name": "Azal", "seo_name": "azal", "has_detailed_info": false, "wines_count": 1337}, {"id": 732, "name": "Avesso", "seo_name": "avesso", "has_detailed_info": false, "wines_count": 948}, {"id": 752, "name": "Batoca", "seo_name": "batoca", "has_detailed_info": false, "wines_count": 31}], "region": {"id": 698, "name": "Vinho Verde", "name_en": "", "seo_name": "vinho-verde", "country": {"code": "pt", "name": "Portugal", "native_name": "Portugal", "seo_name": "portugal", "currency": {"code": "EUR", "name": "Euros", "prefix": "\u20ac", "suffix": null}, "regions_count": 91, "users_count": 1037066, "wines_count": 53763, "wineries_count": 5795, "most_used_grapes": [{"id": 67, "name": "Touriga Nacional", "seo_name": "touriga-nacional", "has_detailed_info": true, "wines_count": 85787}, {"id": 68, "name": "Touriga Franca", "seo_name": "touriga-franca", "has_detailed_info": false, "wines_count": 33763}, {"id": 69, "name": "Tinta Roriz", "seo_name": "tinta-roriz", "has_detailed_info": false, "wines_count": 41047}]}, "parent_id": 818, "background_image": {"location": "//images.vivino.com/regions/backgrounds/_E7OmWQaTruGoqaZy9JhPQ.jpg", "variations": {"large": "//thumbs.vivino.com/region_backgrounds/_E7OmWQaTruGoqaZy9JhPQ_1280x760.jpg", "medium": "//thumbs.vivino.com/region_backgrounds/_E7OmWQaTruGoqaZy9JhPQ_600x356.jpg"}}, "class": {"typecast_map": {"background_image": {}, "class": {}}}, "statistics": {"wineries_count": 539, "wines_count": 3323, "sub_regions_count": 9, "parent_regions_count": 1}}}, {"id": 239, "seo_name": "italian-vino-nobile-di-montepulciano", "regional_name": "Italian", "varietal_name": "Vino Nobile Di Montepulciano", "name": "Italian Vino Nobile Di Montepulciano", "image": null, "background_image": null, "description": "You may not be familiar with Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, but you should be.

It typically showcases lots of red cherry jam and forest floor, and can be as good as some of the best Chianti Classicos.\n\nIt is not as dark or rich as Brunello di Montalcino, but it is typically much more affordable.

(\"feet\"), meaning literally that it \"paints feet red\".\nIt is arguably Russia\u2019s signature grape, distinguishing itself from varieties grown elsewhere thanks to its unique character. This thick skinned grape shows distinctive aromas of wild forest berries such as blackthorn, bilberry, elderberry, redcurrant, as well as crushed black pepper. The wines are typically rich in tannins, alcohol, and acidity. It can be found both in monovarietal wines and in blends with other varieties, such as Cabernet Sauvignon.\nThere are two clones of Krasnostop widely-produced in Russia: Krasnostop Zolotovsky and Krasnostop Anapsky.

It contains red anthocyanin within the grape pulp and the skin thus being one of very few teinturier grapes used in single-varietal winemaking. The berries are medium to large, elliptic or round, dark bluish, and thin-skinned.\n\nHaving its origin in the Kakheti region of Eastern Georgia, Saperavi has northern brethren called Saperavi Severny. Until recent years, Russian winemakers did not differentiate between these two varieties neither on labels nor in technical sheets. Saperavi Severny expose slightly different characteristics in comparison to Saperavi such as significantly higher mildew, grapevine moth and oidium resistivity, higher fertility, excellent winter hardiness. Therefore, Saperavi Severny has larger plantings in Russia than Saperavi.\n\nAs for organoleptic features, Saperavi Severny and Saperavi grapes exhibits distinctive aromas of black fruits (chokeberry and blackthorn in particular), spices (bay leaf) and notes of brined cheese.

This success helped spread the popularity of Russian sparkling wines across Europe.\n\nThe Soviet era brought a proliferation of Russian sparkling wine, thanks to an improvement in the Charmat (tank) fermentation method which is popular nowadays in the production of Prosecco.\n\nToday, Russian sparkling wines vary hugely in style, from highly affordable examples at one end of the spectrum to costly vintage bubbly made by the m\u00e9thode champenoise at the other.
